Goldilocks and the Three {plural noun}

Once a long time ago, there was a young girl with bright golden hair that loved to take long walks through the {place}.  One day she came across a {noun} in the woods that looked warm and comfortable.

It was a cold day and she was tired so she went to the house and knocked {adverb} on the door.  The door was {adverb} open and the smell of {food} wafted from the inside of the house. Tired cold and hungry, Goldilocks stepped into the house and called out hoping to rest for a few and make new friends.

There was no answer but there were 3 bowls on the table with piping hot {food} in them. She tasted the first and the second but they were too {adjective} or too {adjective}. She tasted the third and before she knew it, she had eaten it {adverb}.

After a filling snack Goldilocks decided to take a nap, the first bed she tried was too {adjective}, the second too {adjective}, but the third was so nice that she fell asleep immediately.

She was resting peacefully when three {plural animal} happened into the house and made loud {animal} noises. She awoke and ran screaming from the house.
