Iron Coder Project

Fizz Buzz

## Synopsis

The first Iron Coder challenge is Fizz Buzz, which outputs a list of numbers after performing some substitutions on it.  Sometimes a number will be replaced by "Fizz" and other times it will be replaced by “Buzz” and sometimes both.  

## The Details 

Fizz Buzz is a challenge that is commonly used as an interview question to test an applicant’s coding skills. It involves some core programming concepts such as looping and conditional processing.  Because of this, it is a great place to begin Iron Coder.

The challenge starts with a list of numbers, for this challenge let us say that the list starts with one and goes to 100.  Your solution will look at each number in this list and do one of the following. 

If the number is divisible by 3, output "Fizz"

If the number is divisible by 5, output "Buzz"

If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, output "FizzBuzz"

Otherwise, output the number
